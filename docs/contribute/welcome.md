We are an experimental digital cooperative focused on supporting a future that is more **free**, **fair**, and **open**.  

We contribute to **education**, **research**, and **development** related to open source software which we believe will have a positive impact on society. Our thesis is that  improving how we collaborate and recognize contributions to open source communities will enable us to more effectively cultivate an open source software commons--and that a rich open source software commons will be the the most effective check against tyranny as more and more of our lives are influenced by software.

This idea has lead us to experiment and support the Aragon ecosystem. In fact, our digital cooperative is built on [Aragon](https://aragon.org). We use it to manage membership, track contributions, and allocate shared resources. We see incredible potential in **decentralized autonomous organizations**, despite the ecosystem and tools still being very much in their infancy. By using the Aragon on a daily basis to organize our community, we are able to benefit from a strong feedback loop between our experiences and our contributions.

We also recognize that the biggest challenge in growing a commons is in finding ways to fund the efforts of contributors. This challenge is what sparked the idea for [Apiary](https://github.com/1hive/apairy), a bonding curve based crowdfunding mechanism being developed for Aragon. It is also the underlying motivation for the [commons license](https://github.com/1Hive/commons-license), which we are currently exploring as the foundation of a more sustainable open source software licensing model.

We've documented our process to help new community members get involved and up to speed on how we work together. We currently use a combination of [Keybase](https://keybase.io), [Github](https://github.com), and [Aragon](https://aragon.org) to collaborate. Our process is an ongoing experiment that is continuously evolving as we learn and improve.

If you find anything unclear, please [join our keybase](keybase) and ask us or [open an issue](https://github.com/1Hive/mvp/issues) so that we can help!
