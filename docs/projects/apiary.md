[Apiary](https://github.com/1Hive/apiary) is a mechanism for accountable crowdfunding using bonding curves and a continuous tap. Patrons can deposit funds into the curve in exchange for a patronage token which can be configured in an Aragon organization to offer the patron specific governance rights.

Any rights which can be encoded using Aragon's permissions and app ecosystem can be used with Apiary. So a project might choose to interact with its patrons through non-binding surveys, or grant patrons direct control over the projects finances. 


## Status

Aragon has funded the [Aragon Black](https://aragon.black) team to implement Apiary as a fundraising application available to Aragon Organizations. You can find the main development [repo here](https://github.com/aragonblack/fundraising).

We are contributing to the design, testing, and documentation, and currently discussing how to incorporate [Apiary into our own organization](https://github.com/1Hive/ideas/issues/9).
