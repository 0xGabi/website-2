## Hi 👋
We are a public community organization operating on [Aragon](aragon.org).

We are dedicated to supporting a future that is more **free**, **fair**, and **open**.

We contribute to **education**, **research**, and **development** of open source software which we believe will have a positive impact on society.

Sound cool? [Join us.](handbook.md)

### Our Projects
[1Hive](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/onehive.aragonid.eth) - Our home on Aragon. We are experimenting with and documenting processes and tools developed by [Autark](autark.xyz) and [Aragon One](aragon.one) to coordinate effort in an on-chain cooperative.
**Status:** 👨‍🔬 *Testing*

[Apiary](https://github.com/1Hive/Apiary) - Apiary is mechanism for accountable crowdfunding using bonding curves and a continuous tap. Aragon has funded the [Aragon Black](https://aragon.black) team to implement Apiary as a [fundraising application](https://github.com/aragonblack/fundraising) available to Aragon Organizations.
**Status:** 🛠 *In Development*
