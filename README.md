## About
1Hive is a research and development collective focused on building impactful software for a decentralized future.

We believe in **open source** and that the cross-pollination of effort and ideas across projects leads to a more robust ecosystem.

## Our Projects
[Apiary](https://github.com/1Hive/Apiary) - A curation market platform for the creation and funding of DAOs built on Aragon. It enables entrepreneurs and activists to share their vision and attract high quality collaborators.

[BeeID](https://github.com/1Hive/BeeID) - A decentralized sybil-resistant identity protocol. Users apply for a BeeID by linking their social profiles to a TCR and curators use social graph analysis to determine if a user is a unique person. The registry can be used by other dapps and protocols that require a decentralized sybil resistant identity attestation.

[Hive Commons](https://github.com/1Hive/Hive-Commons) - Is a token for public good. Honey (HNY) is issued based on proof of individuality ([BeeID](https://github.com/1Hive/BeeID)) and is guaranteed to always converge back to an even distribution over time. This unique issuance model may be used to create public interest applications like conservation certifications and public software licenses which transfer the economic value of public goods back to the public.
