# 1Hive Community Portal
## Goal
The goal of the 1Hive community portal is to provide a user friendly and engaging interface where everyone is able to discuss and participate in Hive Commons. 

## User Stories
As a user I want to be able to post a link or text based article that will start a discussion. 

As a user I want to be able to curate posts, bringing attention to the most interesting content. 

As a user I want to seamlessly move from funding projects and tasks, voting in arbitration and governance, and discussing and curating ideas. 

As a user I want to be able to organize information into groups and only see what Iâ€™m most interested in. 

As a user I want to be able to be rewarded for my contributions to the community. 

As a user I do not want to deal with bot accounts, sybil attacks, astroturfing, or other malicious network attacks. 

## Functional and Technical Requirements
1Hive will ultimately look and feel a bit like a web3.0 enabled reddit, where content is curated and organized into sub-communities by members. 

This will require posts, comments, search, and categories or tags. 

In addition each post may support a number of more complex interactions than just upvote or downvote, depending on the post type.
